# Engineering

In addition to my two research experiences (Dr. Fisher and Dr. Aldrich), I've completed five
internships. Four are listed below, and the fifth was at HashiCorp Research, and can be found on 
the research page.

### May 2013 - August 2013

I was a software engineering intern at ModCloth on the Internal Tools team.

I wrote a lot of Go, Python, and bash. I also learned Agile/Scrum, git, vim, HTML/CSS/JS, SQL, Ruby, 
and Ruby on Rails. After work every night, I went home with a headache and laid in bed 
exhausted. It was very tiring and stressful. I still enjoyed my job and my coworkers,
despite starting my on-again/off-again affair with imposture syndrome.

### May 2014 - August 2014

More ModCloth, more internal tools. This time, there was a little more Docker.

### January 2015 â€“ April 2015 

At Clockwise Tees, I was an associate full stack software engineer (but more accurately I was an intern, since
I was only planning on taking a short break from school).

At Clockwise, I was the only in-house developer. My work was full stack + ops. I worked in 
Python/Django, JavaScript (with JQuery), and of course HTML/CSS. I would receive business requirements
from management and translate those into technique requirements, triage stories, and write 
acceptance criteria. Ultimately, I was applying a lot of the skills I learned at ModCloth
independently.

### April 2015 - August 2015

I left my role at Clockwise Tees for an intern position at OThot. At OThot, I was tasked with
developing a prototype frontend for interacting with their machine learning backend.

I architected and implemented two websites total, using AngularJS (1.3.3), Go, Docker, and 
Material Design (Polymer).

This is probably the worst thing I've ever published. Always writing, always growing!
