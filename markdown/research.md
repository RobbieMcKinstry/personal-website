# Graduate School

It's no secret I'm planning to pursue a graduate education. My research interests are in
program synthesis, automated defect repair, program analysis, type theory and language theory.

If you're a principal investigator working in the above, and you're looking for a new 
graduate student, feel free to get in contact with me.

# Current Research: HashiCorp

I'm a full-time research engineer at HashiCorp. At HashiCorp, I work on unannounced security research.
Unfortunately, I can't say anything about this project at present, but I can say that the research
phase is winding down. There *are* next steps for the project, but I'm not sure I can say what they
are. This isn't [blue sky research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blue_skies_research). It's
applied research and the artifacts will eventually be released.

I began at HashiCorp on 15 May 2017 after my graduation from the University of Pittsburgh. I
joined in the first 100 concurrent employees, and as the first research engineer. There are two 
permanent members of the research team: 
[Jon Currey](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=i6jP7qMAAAAJ) and myself. We are overseen by
[Armon Dadgar](https://twitter.com/armon), HashiCorp's co-founder.

Here's proof:

I'm on the left in the pink. This was at the yearly off-site for the Office of the CTO.

HashiCorp's remote-first culture allows me to teach first thing in the morning, a vocation
I creately enjoy. I've always loved the HashiCorp products since my first internship at ModCloth.
It's an incredible pleasure to work so closely with such excellent engineers, and to build my
research portfolio as well.

# Prior Research

## Wyvern

Previously, I worked in the lab of [Jonathan Aldrich](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~aldrich/) at 
Carnegie-Mellon for two years. Dr. Aldrich is most well-known for his work on
[typestate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typestate_analysis) typesystems for Object 
Oriented Languages (see [Plaid](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~aldrich/plaid/).

Under Dr. Aldrich and with the mentorship of 
[Dr. Alex Potanin](http://homepages.mcs.vuw.ac.nz/~alex/), I worked on the
[Wyvern Programming Language](https://wyvernlang.github.io/). Wyvern is a implicitly-typed language,
which means its strongly typed but doesn't have classes. Instead, when an object is created, its
members define its type. A object may only be stored in a variable of type `Foo` if that object
contains all of the methods and fields defined in `Foo`. I honestly believe 
implicit typing will be the way of the future.

## Omega

My first exposure to computer science research was under Dr. David Fisher, one of the minds
behind Ada. Under Dr. Fisher, I implemented an Earley Parser in C for use in the Omega programming 
language. Omega has a property-based type system and its designed to reflect natural language.
