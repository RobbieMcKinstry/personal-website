# Teaching

I'm a teacher at Central Catholic High School. 

# Current Teaching

This fall I'm teaching _Algorithmic Thinking_. The class is offered to juniors and seniors, 
and sophomores who completed Honors Algebra I with a grade of 93% or above or Honors Algebra
II with a grade of 88% or above.

At present, the roster of my class is about half students with an honors mathematics background
and half students wihout.

Students will take daily (partially graded) quizzes on advanced applications of 
previous lessons. The goal of this exercise is to flex the muscle of critial analysis.

Each lesson will begin with a motivating problem. If the problem is solvable with existing
tools in our Python toolbox, then we'll solve it together as a review. However, if the students
don't presently possess the syntax to solve the problem, then the problem will motivate a new
language structure (_i.e._ loops, methods, decision structure).

An explicit nongoal of the class is to teach the semantics of the Python programming language.
One problem I have with most introductory college classes at state schools is that they focus
too heavily on how *Python* works, not on how *programming* works. You don't need to understand
name mangling to learn the basics of programming.

This course is not designed to impart the intricacies of the Python ecosystem. A deep dive
into programming is provided by the AP Computer Science course. This course exposes students to
algorthmic thinking, the discipline of programming, and to abstract problem solving.

## Receiving Honors Credit

Students enrolled in *Algorithmic Thinking* are eligible for Honors Credit. To ensure that no
students are lost during lecture, all Honors requirements will be completed outside of the
classroom. (This approach also has the desirable property that it develops independent study 
habits and autodidacticism, qualities that will aid students no matter where they end up 
after graduation.)

Honors students will be expected to complete a unit on structural types (read as: Python classes).
They will need to complete a homework assignment. Additionally, they must take a 
pass/fail examination.

Finally, Honors students must complete an independent project. The project must be selected from
a list of modules I provide (students can propose their own but only sufficiently rigorous modules
are accepted). Each module will require the student to build a complex system using multiple
technologies not taught in class. The complex system must be deployed to production
by the semester's end.

This project, just like the examination and the homework assignment, are pass/fail. Honors students
are graded the same as non-Honors students. However, they will receive the benefit of
higher weighting on their Quality Grade Point Average (QPA).

# High School and College

I am a alum of Central Catholic, class of 2012. When I was a student, I did a lot
of careful thought about which processes worked well, which didn't, and what I would
do differently. Throughout college, I reformulated my thoughts on process and asked
my collegues for feedback on "how I'd do it differently". During that time, 
I completed over 500 hours of _pro-bono_ tutoring in computer science on topics including

- basic programming

- data structures and algorithms

- systems software 

- artificial intelligence

- devops 

- web development

- cloud computing

and more.

# Previous Teaching

Previously, I co-taught *Honors Jave II* at Central Catholic High School. This course met
every other day for one period, and students completed the quizzes, examinations, labs, and
projects for Pitt's **CS 0401: Intermediate Java**. Students received four Pitt credits for
enrollment. All students all completed the AP Computer Science Exam.

Despite these deliverables, the course curriculum included topics beyond the scope of AP
Computer Science. Topics we covered included:

- git, GitHub (all assignments we submitted via GitHub Education)

- Unix small tools

- Runtime Analysis (Big O notation)

- Type systems, including Structural, Abstract, and Interface types

- Refinement and dependent types

- A few fun half-lectures on Alan Turing and the Perlis Epigrams.
